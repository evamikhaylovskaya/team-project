I searched the uploaded workflow chunks and produced a Markdown summary for each workflow. Where the uploaded files did not include descriptive details, I wrote "Not found in uploaded files." Each workflow name below is cited to the corresponding uploaded file chunk.

(The list of workflow files in the upload is recorded in the workflows.json chunk.) 

If you want, I can open and extract more detailed fields (actions, triggers, descriptions) from each workflow file—tell me which workflow(s) to inspect and I’ll pull the available details from the uploaded chunks.
